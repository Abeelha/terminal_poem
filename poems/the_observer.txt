=======================================
           THE OBSERVER                 
=======================================

i have become the silence deep
in rooms where noise pretends to think
the pause where borrowed thoughts all sleep
the void that brings them to the brink

---------------------------------------

minute three: they quote a screen
minute seven: contradict  
minute twelve: they see between
minute thirteen: they're conflict-strict

---------------------------------------

they mistake my quiet stance
for absence or for being meek
but I'm more present in my trance
than they are when they choose to speak
