ctrl+c, ctrl+v, the modern way
where thoughts are borrowed, never taught
the graveyard where ideas decay
and originality's been caught

---------------------------------------

we are the generation's echo sound
bouncing off these pixel walls
each reflection weaker, less profound
until the final meaning falls

---------------------------------------

in this ctrl+c society's grip
we've forgotten how to make
lost the code, can't run the script
consciousness.bat won't wake
